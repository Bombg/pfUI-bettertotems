# pfUI Better Totems
Looks and works very similarly to pfUI's default totem module, but with extra features.

## Features
- Looks exactly like pfUI's default totem timer
- Totem timers disappear when you cast Totemic Recall (Turtle WoW spell)
- Totem timer for an individual totem is cleared if that totem is destroyed
- Totem timer turns red if you out range a totem
- Sends a reminder to recall your totems if they are too far away

I'm new to modding WoW, so I learned from other addons. Most of the code in this addon isn't mine
- pfUI's original totem module, it's mostly the same code.
